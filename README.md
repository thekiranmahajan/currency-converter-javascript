Hello hello.. fellows 😂,

Here again with a new JavaScript project {10/12}: currency-converter-javascript



I've already made a similar project with React.js too but with Js, it's kind of complex due to state change {Exact problem that FB devs had while making React 😂}

💸Feature💸

🍭 As always cool looking for modern web design with top-quality CSS.

🍭 Used the concepts of JavaScript such as for-in loop, fetch API, toFixed, async-await, parseFloat, template literals, innerHTML, addEventlistener, DOM manipulation, arrow-functions, etc.

🍭 Populated the whole object keys of currency object and created options in the select tag.

🍭 Created separate methods for exchange calculations and fetching data from API calls.

🍭 Added a swap button to swap values of input fields and called the method for rate conversion.

🍭 Dynamic selection of option as a selected option in HTML using DOM manipulation.

🍭 Every change in the value of options or input fields executes the respective function for reflecting data on UI.

🍭 Added try-catch to handle errors of API calls and also integrated the respective errors in UI.

🍭 lot more such small as well as complex features.😊
